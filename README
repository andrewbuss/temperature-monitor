Embedded software for an AVR-based temperature monitor.

 - Retains one week of data for three temperature sensors, with 1-minute and 0.0625 C resolution
 - Minimizes page writes by caching data until written to EEPROM every twenty minutes
 - For longevity, each EEPROM page experiences only three write cycles per week
 - Fault-tolerant ring buffer storage - the start of the buffer is marked by a blank page
 - Interactive serial console
 - Real-time thermometer display of data from three sensors
 - Graphical data review with scrolling and adjustable scope (1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 1 week)

Uses I2C to pull data from TMP102 temperature sensors
Uses two-wire interface to driving EEPROM memory
Uses a non-standard serial interface to drive a 128x64 LCD display
